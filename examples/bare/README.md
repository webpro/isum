# isum example: bare

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/webpro/isum/tree/main/examples/bare)

No-build browser-only example with signals (`@preact/signals-core`) and
[import map](./index.html).

Note that isum does not provide additional value here, other than having a
single dependency to import from (rather than from both `uhtml` and
`@preact/signals-core` separately) and/or being an exploration step when trying
things out.

## dev

For both development and production, serve `index.html` statically.

## build

N/A
